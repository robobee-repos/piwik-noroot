# Piwik

## Description

The image modifies the base image to run as non-privileged user `www-data`. Furthermore, it adds the option to have a input directory for configuration files that can be used with Kubernetes Config Map. In addition, it adds rsync to synchronize the Piwik source from `/usr/src/piwik` to `/var/www/html` the web root directory. That is necessary if the web root directory is mounted as a Kubernetes Persistent Volume.
